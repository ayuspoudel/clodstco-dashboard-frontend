/* 
  This is the main global stylesheet for the project.
  It’s the only CSS file imported directly in `main.js`.

  We don’t write actual styles in here.
  Instead, this file just imports all the other CSS files from `src/styles/`.

  Everything is flat inside `styles/` — no nested folders.
  Just one file per concern.

  If you're adding new global styles:
  → create a new file in `styles/` and import it here.

  DO NOT write random styles directly in this file.
  Keep it clean. Keep it modular.
